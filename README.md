# Runner-Game-by-UnrealEngine4

## Introduction

 - A small project I made to run for fun.
 - 使用虚幻4引擎做的跑酷小游戏

 - Actually I made this version at 2017.5.10, and I have made a newer version, but my VisualStudio 2015 has been uninstalled, UE can't recognize my VisualStudio 2017, so I can't make the package for the latest version. Sad...

 - I upload the package in zips so that you can download it and see. It contains a basic UI with button, text and setting.
Also, in the game, it contained randomly road generator, the coin collect system and so on.
